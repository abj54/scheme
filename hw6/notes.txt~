1. Apart from the fact that most of the primitive procedures are not
installed, it could not carry out even the simplest procedures like +,
\. Similarly, it would kick me out if there was any error without
warning. But a good thing I noticed here was it would remember any
thing that you would define in the s450 even if you came of of s450
and went back in. It was fun to figure it out as the variable is
stored in the environemnt (frame of the environment) and as long as
anything is performed in the root frame, it also stays there. It can
be seen by viewing the global environment.
