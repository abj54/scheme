Problem 1 was fairly straight forward considering the same thing was
done in hw6 as well. The table was created in the similar way and I
also wrote the basic type-of and bare-symbol functions as suggested by
the professor. The only tricky part was editing out
make-elementary-exp so that we could deal with label taking register
assignment. For this I simply added an extra cond statement to check
that it is a label and contains a list (which would be a register), as
long as I have that I can simply deal with both of those at
once. During testing phase, I was confused at one point when the
machine would crash when the input given was a special-form. It was
due to the fact that order matters in this case. I was dealing with
variable before the bare-symbol and hence the code treated the
special-form as variable and crashed the machine. For this simply
changing the order was sufficient.

Problem 2 for me was a combination of ev-if and ev-sequence. I had
to add few more checks in
