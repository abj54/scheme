Question: why are the quotes necessary?

--> Quotes are necessary so that scheme doesnot go on and try to
evaluate them which will result in the error when running the code.

The core task of the application written is to simplify the units
and perform the normalization task:
 U = (u/v) * v
 aU = (av/v) * v

But this is also one of the simplest task to perform after you are
able to compute the value of u and v since a is simply 'car' of the
U. The biggest task is hence to be able to compute u and v which can
be obtained only after being able to translate U and V into respective
base list. That is the hardest part of the assignment.

Since we are given that the baseunits only comprise of kg, m and sec,
my idea comprised of keeping track of power of these 3 units.
Similarly, the given U and V while normalizing may produce different
coefficients which also had to be tracked. So I decided to use a list
for this and described it as finallist as:

    (coefficient (kg kg-power) (m m-power) (sec sec-power))

I had to use differenthelpful functions that kept track of the power
and kept increasing/decreasing it on basis of the power of the unit
that has been passed i.e. (km 2) --> 1000^2 (m 2). So, the power had
to be used to compute the new coefficient as well. With getbaselist
procedure, I obtained a list of units with different coefficient and
bases which then I had to use in the updatelist proccedure.

      (getbaselist '((m 1) (kg 2))) -->
      ((1 (m 1)) (1 (kg 2)))

Updatelist has the task of updating the finallist on the basis of
baselist obtained from getbaselist procedure. And I was able to update
the finallist by simplyreading 3 values from each sublist in the
baselist. But that processed failed as soon as I tried to test it with
the derived units

    (getbaselist '((n 1) (kg 2)))-->
     ((1 (kg 1) (m 1) (sec -2)) (1 (kg 2)))

Here, mu updatelist only worked with 2 kg units and discarded the m and
sec units completely. To be able to deal with each unit in a list was
hard part for me as I could
